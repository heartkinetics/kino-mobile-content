The OKCARDIO application: the tool that will allow your doctor to make a cardiac diagnosis remotely
thanks to the measurements you record with your smartphone. Currently the application is in clinical trial. Place your phone on your chest
for 60 seconds to receive an information about your heart rate and heart force of contraction. In the future, the results will be sent to the doctor, on our secure server,
to help him objectify any symptoms, a weakening or a change in heart function or prevent complications or hospitalization.
