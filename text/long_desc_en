The OKCARDIO application: the tool that allows your doctor to make a cardiac diagnosis remotely
thanks to the measurements you record with your smartphone. Place your phone on your chest
for 60 seconds and let yourself be guided. The results are sent to the doctor, on our secure server,
to help him objectify any symptoms, a weakening or a change in heart function
or prevent complications or hospitalization.
